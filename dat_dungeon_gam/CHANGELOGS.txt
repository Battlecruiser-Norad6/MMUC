1/6/2018 4:15PM - Jason TLDR : VERSION 1 COMPLETED
>further improved position class (overriding for assignment operators)
>Now we can include starting position and ending position IN the text file
>New function to evaluate board size based on text file alone.
>major fix to collision, now after collision with wall, hero can move normally
	(this wasn't resolved nicely in the last update)
>major fix to dungeon class, including a variety of new functions to ease information flow
	between dungeon class and the game_master class
>added victory condition, now we have an actual game
	the game will end with the hero touches the 't' (don't ask me why this character)

[idea]
>GUI can be better fixed...
